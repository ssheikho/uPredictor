1) Analyze the velocity profile as projected along the linear path and see what happens.

2) If the arm basically does a linear interpolation across its DOF, resulting in the path.

3) A linear interpolation across the robot's joints follows a path that is non-planar and wobbles about the plane. What of a real human motion?

4) There are two relevant accelerations here, one is angular acceleration, and one is through space. The question is, which varies less with respect to the overall length of the reach?
