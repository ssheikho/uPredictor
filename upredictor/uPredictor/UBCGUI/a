CMake Warning (dev) at UBCUtil/CMakeLists.txt:35 (add_library):
  Policy CMP0002 is not set: Logical target names must be globally unique.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0002" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at GUIExample/CMakeLists.txt:51 (link_directories):
  This command specifies the relative path

    ../UBCGUI

  as a link directory.

  Policy CMP0015 is not set: link_directories() treats paths relative to the
  source dir.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0015" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at GUIExample/CMakeLists.txt:57 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "GUIExample" links to some libraries for which the linker
  must search:

    opencv_calib3d, opencv_core, opencv_features2d, opencv_flann
    opencv_highgui, opencv_imgproc, opencv_legacy, opencv_ml, opencv_objdetect
    opencv_video, glfw, GL, GLU, glut, -lgtk-3, -lgdk-3, -lpangocairo-1.0
    -lpango-1.0, -latk-1.0, -lcairo-gobject, -lcairo, -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0
    -lgio-2.0, -lgobject-2.0, -lglib-2.0

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /home/justin/Research/Code/upredictor/uPredictor/UBCGUI/libubcgui.so
    /home/justin/Research/Code/upredictor/uPredictor/UBCUtil/libubcutil.a

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
